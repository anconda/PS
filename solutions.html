      <h2>Solutions to Deforestation</h2>
      <p>Although deforestation is a serious global issue, there are many effective solutions that can help preserve and restore our forests.</p>

      <h3>1. Reforestation and Afforestation</h3>
      <p>Planting trees in deforested areas (reforestation) or where forests never existed (afforestation) helps restore ecosystems, absorb carbon, and prevent soil erosion.</p>

      <h3>2. Sustainable Agriculture and Forestry</h3>
      <p>Using eco-friendly farming techniques, like crop rotation and agroforestry, helps reduce the need to clear new land. Sustainable logging ensures that forests can regenerate naturally.</p>

      <h3>3. Protected Areas and Conservation Laws</h3>
      <p>Governments can establish protected national parks and enforce laws against illegal logging. Supporting forest-friendly policies is crucial for long-term protection.</p>

      <h3>4. Reduce Demand for Forest Products</h3>
      <p>Consumers can help by buying recycled paper, certified sustainable wood, and reducing meat consumption, which lowers demand for pastureland in cleared forests.</p>

      <h3>5. Education and Awareness</h3>
      <p>Teaching people — especially young generations — about the importance of forests empowers them to make better choices and take action for the planet.</p>

      <p>Many of these solutions are already working in parts of the world. With enough support and effort, we can stop deforestation and restore the world’s forests.</p>
