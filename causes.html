  <h2>Causes of Deforestation</h2>
  <img src="images/causes.avif" alt="Forest Deforestation Causes Banner" class="banner-cau" />

  <p>Deforestation is primarily driven by human activity, and its causes are complex and interconnected. Understanding these causes is essential to finding effective solutions. Below are the major contributors to the global loss of forests:</p>

  <h3>1. Agriculture Expansion</h3>
  <p><strong>Commercial agriculture</strong> is the single largest cause of deforestation, especially in tropical regions. Forests are cleared to grow crops like soy, coffee, cocoa, and especially for large-scale <strong>cattle ranching</strong>. For example, in the Amazon Basin, nearly 80% of deforestation is linked to cattle grazing and soy production for animal feed.</p>

  <h3>2. Logging and Timber Harvesting</h3>
  <p>Logging for <strong>timber, furniture, construction materials, and paper</strong> products is a major driver of forest loss. While some logging is legal and regulated, much of it is <strong>illegal or unsustainable</strong>, leading to rapid degradation. Logging roads also open up previously untouched forests to further exploitation.</p>

  <h3>3. Urbanization and Infrastructure Development</h3>
  <p>With the global population growing rapidly, forests are being cleared for <strong>housing developments, highways, industrial zones, and utilities</strong>. In many developing countries, unplanned urban sprawl is consuming forests at an accelerating rate, particularly near city outskirts.</p>

  <h3>4. Mining and Resource Extraction</h3>
  <p>Mining for <strong>gold, copper, oil, coal, and rare earth minerals</strong> requires clearing large areas of land. These activities not only destroy forests directly but also cause <strong>toxic runoff and soil contamination</strong>, making it difficult for ecosystems to recover. In Indonesia and the Congo Basin, mining is a growing threat to tropical rainforests.</p>

  <h3>5. Fires – Natural and Human-Induced</h3>
  <p>While some forest fires occur naturally, many are <strong>intentionally set by humans</strong> to clear land for farming. These fires can easily get out of control, especially during dry seasons, and cause widespread destruction. Climate change is also increasing the frequency and intensity of wildfires.</p>

  <h3>6. Infrastructure for Dams and Hydropower</h3>
  <p>Large dam projects for energy production often flood vast areas of forest. These projects not only lead to deforestation but also disrupt the ecosystems and Indigenous communities that depend on those forests.</p>

  <h3>7. Climate Change (as a Feedback Loop)</h3>
  <p>Although deforestation contributes to climate change, changing climate patterns—such as increased drought and shifting rainfall—can further weaken forests, making them more susceptible to degradation and fires.</p>

  <p>By identifying and understanding these causes, we can focus our efforts on promoting sustainable practices, enforcing environmental laws, and protecting remaining forest ecosystems.
